## About

Sorting Visualizer is a project that aims to make sorting algorithms more accessible and understandable to users. It provides an interactive way to visualize popular sorting algorithms like **Merge Sort, Bubble Sort** and **Quick Sort**. Users can adjust the array size and sorting speed, and the application provides step-by-step visualization with detailed explanations.

## Technologies Used

-   **React:** The application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

-   **HTML & CSS:** Structuring and styling the application to provide an interactive and user-friendly experience.

-   **Material UI:** Buttons, Icons, Slider and Typography components.

-   **npm:** Manages project dependencies and handles various scripts for building and running the application.

-   **gh-pages:** Hosting the demo.

-   **Create React App:** Initial project template.


## Features

-  *Real-time Visualization:* Visualize popular sorting algorithms in real-time, allowing you to see how they work step by step.
-  *Customizable:* Choose the speed of the visualization to match your preference and adjust the number of elements in the array to be sorted.
-  *Clear and Reset:*Clear the current visualization and start over with a new array.


## Installation
